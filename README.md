# banking_app

Create a banking app (user console for now), that would do few simple tasks (for now). 
 - Ask user to create account (In that case you need to provide your email address, and then the app will give you ID and password)
 - Log In to bank service (you check email and password . Email and ID should be linked) email -> ID -> password.

 - Code must be speared through different modules (separate files)
 - Logging, Git should be in place. 
 - Use class structures and access modifiers (private and protected)
